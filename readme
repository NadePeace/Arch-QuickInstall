In my daily routine, I perform approximately four to five Arch installs. However, I found myself repeatedly installing the same applications, which became tedious.

While there are numerous scripts available online that offer similar functionality, I sought a distinct approach that would allow me to separate my applications.

I am sharing this script here in the hope that it may be of assistance to others.

The provided lists contain the applications I require. Please feel free to modify them to better suit your specific needs.
